# **Manual Clustering Algorithms for High-Dimensional Biological Data**

This repository contains three Python implementations of **manual clustering algorithms** specifically designed for **high-dimensional biological datasets**. Each algorithm demonstrates different approaches to uncover underlying structures in complex data, with an emphasis on **interpretability, evaluation, and visualization**.

## **Project Overview**
High-dimensional biological data, such as **gene expression profiles**, often suffers from:
- **Noise and sparsity**
- **Complex inter-sample relationships**
- **Difficulty in defining true clusters**

This project explores three manual clustering approaches that:
- Construct **robust similarity measures**.
- Integrate **graph-based clustering methods**.
- Provide **quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics**.
